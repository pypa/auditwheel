    Useful when you want to use `InTemporaryDirectory` for the final test, but
    you are still debugging.  For example, you may want to do this in the end:

    >>> with InTemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    ...     # do something complicated which might break
    ...     pass

    But indeed the complicated thing does break, and meanwhile the
    ``InTemporaryDirectory`` context manager wiped out the directory with the
    temporary files that you wanted for debugging.  So, while debugging, you
    replace with something like:

    >>> with InGivenDirectory() as tmpdir: # Use working directory by default
    ...     # do something complicated which might break
    ...     pass

    You can then look at the temporary file outputs to debug what is happening,
    fix, and finally replace ``InGivenDirectory`` with ``InTemporaryDirectory``
    again.
